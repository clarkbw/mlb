# MLB App

This is an MLB (Major League Baseball) Application.  It's a very simple responsive designed application that retrieves scores from the MLB site in a similar way that the MLB Chrome Extension does.  This app does require the use of the [mlb-proxy](https://github.com/clarkbw/mlb-proxy/) to proxy the MLB API due to the [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) restrictions currently in place with the MLB API.

## Tech

This is a [volo](https://github.com/volojs/volo) built [Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/apps) designed to run as a full screen web app for platforms that support it.
